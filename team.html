          <p>Carrie was born and raised in Southern California. Though she lived abroad and in Los Angeles for several years, she’s primarily lived in Orange County where she has been raising her two children for the past 10 years. 
Carrie became involved in working with women after the birth of her first child, when she quickly realized she was being called to empower women by teaching them the powerful hypnosis techniques she used for her birth experience. She began serving woman as a certified Hypno-doula and then as a Hypnobabies Childbirth Hypnosis® Instructor. Her passion for hypnosis and for women’s wellness and healing expanded to include hypnotherapy work, when she become a Certified Hypnotist with the National Guild of Hypnotists, and then a certified Transpersonal Hypnotherapist, to continue her deep, transformational healing work for the mind/body/soul. Carrie believes that when you heal women, you heal the world, and this is never more so than the mothers of the world, as they are gifted with raising the next generation. Carrie is equally as passionate about raising children consciously and peacefully, as honoring the child as a unique human affords them more security to realize and manifest the gifts they each hold within themselves that the world needs.</p>

          <p>Bea brings 15 years’ experience as an accountant, having worked for an engineering firm, a home builder, and presently, a real estate investment company.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Bea was primarily raised in Manila, Philippines before her family moved to the United States when she was a teen. She spent almost 20 years living in the Washington, D.C. metro area, where she earned her Bachelor’s degree in Accounting from George Mason University.</p>

<p>She is highly seasoned in handling day-to-day operational accounting, cash management, financial statement preparation, sales reporting and project tracking.</p>

<p>Bea has always had family and friends who suffer from various mental health conditions, but it was in her early 20s when she personally had her first battles with depression and anxiety.  She realized that there is not enough compassion and support for these issues even though many people struggle every day. Adding to the struggle is that there seems to be shame felt in discussing mental health, and there is not enough awareness and belief that it is important.  Bea is very excited to work with ELF in educating others about mental wellness, promoting healing, and offering therapeutic tools and resources to those who need it most.</p>

I wonder if virtual meetings can ever truly take the place of face-to-face meetings as the world becomes more and more “virtual.”
I hear the laughter of clients and attendees as I play event planner/problem solver/comedian, turning challenging situations into positive ones!
I see the need to pick up my phone on the first ring and respond to emails asap, because excellent customer service is something I strive to provide every day.
I want my coworkers, clients, HCPs, and venue contacts to know that I am their partner.
I am Sheryl Erani.</p>
