Children who are emotionally intelligent are able to: recognize their own emotions and those of othersdiscern between different feelings and name them appropriatelyuse emotional information to guide thinking, problem solving and behaviorbe able to manage their emotions and adapt to changing environments Traits of people who have well developed high emotional intelligence include: being positive.choosing to be friends with other positive people.setting healthy boundaries.being assertive when necessarynot dwelling on the past.knowing how to enjoy the moment and deal with disappointmentsdescribing themselves as happy.empathizing with others.knowing when to say yes or no in situations These are all qualities that can help children become confident, discerning and socially strong. When you teach children emotional intelligence, how to recognize their feelings, understand where they come from and learn how to deal with them, you teach them one of the most essential skills for their success in life. Research has shown that Emotional Intelligence predicts over 54% of the variation in success for relationships, effectiveness, health and quality of life. Additional data concludes that young people with high EQ earn higher grades, stay in school and make healthier choices. Google it appears also looks for people with well developed emotional intelligence in its hiring process. High test results in STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) are not enough on their own.Google wants to know if potential employees are able to connect with others, recognize other people’s thoughts and feelings, read situations and people and respond accordingly. The Washington Post recently reported that: “The seven top characteristics of success at Google are all soft skills: being a good coach; communicating and listening well; possessing insights into others (including others different values and points of view); having empathy toward and being supportive of one’s colleagues; being a good critical thinker and problem solver; and being able to make connections across complex ideas.” By developing Emotional Intelligence in children at a young age, we can set them on a path to success in all aspects of their lives.
