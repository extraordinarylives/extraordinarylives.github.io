Other tickets were donated to families at-risk. The message from everyone was as loud and clear as the bright green of our T shirts and sponge hands that popped against the red of the Angels’ fans. High Five for Mental Health! Away with the stigma! We are all in this together! Everyone was having fun high fiving anyone who crossed their path. The event took place on the day before Mother’s Day and it was wonderful to see so many families with young children and teenagers at the game. You could spot the ELF/CHOC squad from anywhere in the stadium, neon shirts and hats aglow.
