<meta name="description" content="On Wednesday, February 27, 2019, laughter rang around the Irvine Improv at our first annual Comedy Night entitled Let Laughter Shed Light. Mental illness is no laughing matter, yet love and laughter enable us all to cope better with what life throws at us. There was a wonderful sense of camaraderie at the event and a true feeling that we are all in this together. The fun started with guests being enthusiastically greeted by a life size Piggie Bear and volunteers dressed in black with a touch of green to represent mental health. Barely a person passed up the opportunity to pose for a photo with Piggie Bear. Silent Auction Once inside, there was a buzz of activity and anticipation as guests perused the many fabulous items on offer in the Silent Auction. There were gifts certificates for yoga, gym memberships, restaurants, the Lakers, singing lessons, golf lessons and massage, as well as for the many wonderful healers that ELF is connected to. The tables were laden with stunning fine jewelry, bubbly and bath products, perfumes, Scotch &amp; chocs to name but a few. The Pre-show Young performers from the Center Stage Studio warmed up the audience as they shared their talent for singing and dancing in lively routines. Joe Grande, master of ceremonies extraordinaire kept the pace moving with his own inimitable style and good humor. The Comedians Stand up comedy is not an easy discipline but these professionals had the audience eating out of their hands. First up was Mary Kennedy, best known for “New Fiona” on Shameless, Conan and being a regular at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Mary is hilariously self deprecating as she made fun of her post baby body and had every woman in the room nodding helplessly in agreement. Eric Deskin has an edgy, observant brand of humor and the audience lapped up his East Coast take on California. At one point in his life Eric was a lawyer and while rumors of his disbarment have been grossly exaggerated, he advised the audience to ask him for legal advice at their own peril! Francis DiLorenzo is tall and slender and a magnificent physical comedienne. The laughter built as she told tales of dating shorter men. My personal favorite was her impersonation of her 6’3” son and his similarity to an air filled dancing balloon man. Hilarious! You can see why next up Justine Marino was selected as the New Face of Comedy at Montreal’s prestigious Just for Laughs Festival and laugh we did. Who else do you know who fantasizes about having a Jurassic Park wedding? “I dino…” To close out the evening Sam Fedele made sure that our jaws ached from laughing. Sam developed his high-energy style of comedy growing up in the mean streets of New Jersey. He spent six years honing his skills in the United States Marine Corps, after which neither Sam nor the Marine Corps would ever be the same again. ELF sends out a huge thank you to all the fabulous entertainers for sharing their talents and shedding light on mental health. The entertainers, guests and volunteers made the evening a spectacular success." />
